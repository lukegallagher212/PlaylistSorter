# PlaylistSorter
Sorts songs into specific playlists based on their composition.

## How?
This program looks at the assigned pop, country, and rock values of the songs based on a percentage scale from 0-100 and suggests a playlist
they would best fit in, some songs can't be fit into any and therefore need to be regected. Others can be added but you have the ability to add/regect at will.

Make sure to add input and playlist files as they are read by the program, these txt files can be configured to different songs and compositions.
